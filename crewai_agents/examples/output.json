        "Remdesivir is included in both global and generic COVID-19 treatment guidelines, although disease-specific guideline details are limited in the sources retrieved. Recent peer-reviewed publications from 2019-2024 indicate ongoing clinical research and case reports on remdesivir's effectiveness and safety, including its use in patients with co-morbidities and possible cardiac side effects. News reports from India highlight regulatory actions such as restricted emergency use approval, export bans, clinical guidelines issuance, and issues around black marketing, reflecting the significant role and challenges of remdesivir use in COVID-19 management in the region."
